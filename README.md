This workspace contains a basic Android Java app structure compatible with Android Studio and VS Code.

## Project Structure
- `app/` - Main application module
  - `src/main/java/com/example/myapp/MainActivity.java` - Main activity
  - `src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - App manifest
  - `src/main/res/` - Resources (layouts, drawables, etc.)
- `build.gradle` - App-level Gradle build file
- `settings.gradle` - Project-level Gradle settings

## Build & Run Instructions

2. Run `./gradlew build` to build the app.
3. Use Android Studio or VS Code to launch the app on an emulator or device.
